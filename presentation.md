^ I am not a JavaScript expert. I am known as a JavaScript hater

# [fit] However ...

<br>

# [fit] Modern JS no longer makes me üò±

# [fit] Over time I'm mostly ü§î

# But also ...

## I'm not a fan of the asset pipeline

# sbecker shoutout for asset packager!

# Modern Javascript Tools

---

# Not settling for the status quo

---

# Webpack

> webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.

---

# Webpack

> It is incredibly configurable

---

# Webpack

> But editing/adding-to a webpack config requires some more than cursory understanding of webpack

---

# Packaging Javascript code

> Where is the `gem` equivalent in JavaScript land?

---

# npm

- If you've done any javascript work with `npm` you know it is a :angry: experience
- Most frustrating: sllllooooowwwww

---

# Yarn

## fast
## caching
## parallelize

---

# Yarn

> Will use this to download packages and all of their dependencies

<br>

> There are a *LOT* of dependencies...

---

# Asset Pipeline

> Sprockets

- A great gem but reproduces a lot of what the JS world already has
- Maintenance is apparently quite difficult

---

# Can we merge the two?

# [fit] rails/webpacker

---

# Small gem

- Mostly configuration
- ... and passing information to existing tools

---

# Rails "4.2"..."5.1"

## Officially deployed as part of 5.1

- At the same time we :skull: jQuery as a standard dependency

---

# Getting started

`https://github.com/rails/webpacker`

---

# Rails "4.2"..."5.1"

## Add gem to Gemfile

- For < `5.1`
- `gem 'webpacker', github: 'rails/webpacker'`

---

# Rails 5.1

`rails new --webpack`
`rails new --webpack=react`
`rails new --webpack=angular`

---

# MOAR CONFIGS!

- `config/webpack/*.js`

> Follows similar conventions of ruby configs
> Broken down into dev, test, prod

> Yet Another Place For Code

# [fit] `app/javascript/packs/*`

---

# Each js file is the name of a `pack`

> These can be brought into a page with

> `javascript_pack_tag 'NAME'`

---

# Each css file is also the name of a `pack`

> These can be brought into a page with

> `stylesheet_pack_tag 'NAME'`

---

# [fit] Lets look at the sample

> ./bin/webpack-dev-server
> rails s

// config/webpack/loaders/react.js
// .babelrc

"presets": [
  "react",
  "es2015",
  "stage-0",
  ["env", { "modules": false }]
]
```

# [fit] Lets make some `React` components!

## Managed Javascript Dependencies
### (no more downloading js bundles)
## Keep up with the _Joneses_
## es{2015,2016,2017} is a _decent_ version of javascript
